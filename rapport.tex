	\subsection{Main Issue}

	The amount of elderly people is increasing quickly in the Netherlands. \cite{bevolkingspiramide} The nursing homes can't keep up with the pace and have structural issues. They don't have enough experienced staff and there are a lot of problems with the medication delivery. The elderly also feel that they don't have enough freedom. \cite{structureleproblemen}	 
	
	Because of that, there is a lot of pressure on the caregivers. If we don't reach a solution soon, there will be few places left for new elderly in nursing homes or the quality of care will be lower.
	
	\subsection{Problems With Doors}
	Many of the elderly have difficulities with moving through the nursing home. There are a lot of doors where for example, elderly in wheelchairs, can get stuck because the doors close to quickly. There are also doors which won't open automatically, so they require a caregiver to open it. All these problems take valuable time from the caregiver, who could be doing a lot more important things than opening doors. They also take a lot of time and trouble from the elderly. 
	
	\subsection{Emergency Alert Problems}
	There are also elderly people who have trouble with the emergency alert buttons in the nursing homes. Some of the elderly are paralyzed and have a lot of pain when they're laying in a bad position in bed at night. At those times, they can't reach the emergency alert button and have to wait till morning before they're assisted.
	
	\subsection{Facial recognition and Emotion recognition}
	The way to solve these problems is to use facial recognition for automatically unlocking and opening doors. Which of course requires all doors to have motors to open them. With facial recognition you could also use emotion recognition to see if elderly people are in pain and need care.
